# The Highway Machine
### Cheating. Simplified.
As I got to a point in my world in which I wanted to build ice highways in the nether to get from A to B quickly, I realized that even if you want to cheat, typing in all the /fill commands is a lot of work.
This is where the Highway Machine comes in clutch: You tell it where it should build the highway, and it does it (or gives you (one!!) command to do so)
## Usage:
- Download the repo or the .py script
- run the script
- (Choose the blocks in which you want the highway to be built) - Optional
- Type in the coords of the first & last block of the highway (must be straight line)
- Place a Command block in your world, paste the command in (already in clipboard), power the Command Block
- Profit
## Features
- Customizable Blocks
## Soon-to-be-features (maybe)
- minecraft mod/datapack (?)
- more customisation
## Limitatioms
- Player must have OP & must go in creative mode due to Command Block (command is too long to be run in chat)
- only works in simulation distance
